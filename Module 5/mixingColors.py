# This program asks the user to enter the name of two primary colors.
# Once two primary color names are enteres, the color of of the resulting mix

# letter q or quit is typed to quit the program

# I am using the Comment Anchors extension for Visual Studio Code which utilizes specific keywords
# to allow for quick navigation around the file by creating sections and anchor points. Any use
# of "ANCHOR", "TODO", "FIXME", "STUB", "NOTE", "REVIEW", "SECTION", and "LINK" are used in conjunction with 
# this extension

# SECTION - Imports and variables
from os import system, name
# !SECTION

# SECTION - Functions

# !SECTION

# SECTION - Main

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # TODO - Welcome Message
    # TODO - Infinite Loop 
    # TODO - Get Colors
