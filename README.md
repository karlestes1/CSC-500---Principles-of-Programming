# CSC 500 - Principles of Programming

**Disclaimer:** These project were built as a requirement for CSC 500: Principles of Programming through Colorado State University Global under the instruction of Dr. Lori Farr. Unless otherwise noted, all programs were created to adhere to explicit guidelines as outlined in the assignment requirements I was given. Descriptions of each assignment can be found below.

*****This repository is actively being updated and will be archived upon my completion of the class*****

### Textbook
The textbook for this class was specially designed and is hosted on zyBooks to allow for interactive programming while learning the concepts
<br />

### VS Code Python Extension
I am using the Python extension for Visual Studion Code which includes the ability to create python cells which can be individually run in an interactive window. The syntax to create a cell is as follows: 
```python
#%%
```
Any line with these three characters on it denotes the beginning of a python cell and is included due to the utilization of the python extension.

## Assignments
### Module 1: [Python Program to Add Two Numbers](Module%201/addTwoNums.py)
- A simple python program to find the addition and subtraction of two numbers
- Asks the user to input two numbers, performs simple mathematical operations on the inputs, and displays the resulting output

### Module 2: [Retail Total](Module%202/addTwoNums.py)
- A python program that prompts the user to input prices for 5 different items
- Calculates the subtotal of those item costs and the total with a 7% sales tax
- Outputs the results to the terminal
- I went overboard and added some ascii art
